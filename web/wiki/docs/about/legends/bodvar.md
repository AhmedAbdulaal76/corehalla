## Lore

### The Unconquered Viking, The Great Bear

<Quote author="- The Saga of Bödvar Bearson, first stanza">

“I speak, you noble vikings, of a warrior who surpassed you all. I tell of a
great bear-man who overcame giants and armies, and of how he came to leave our
world and challenge the Gods.”

<Quote author="- Bödvar to Heimdall, the guardian of the gates of Asgard">

Listen you nine-mothered bridge troll, I'm coming in, and the first beer I'm
drinking is the one in your fist.

### As the story goes...

Born of a viking mother and bear father, Bödvar grew up feared and mistrusted by
his own people.

Bödvar's first nemesis was the terrible giant bear Grothnar, his own brother. By
defeating Grothnar in a battle that lasted seven days, Bödvar chose to side with
humanity and became the protector of the people of the north. He led his
Skandian People against the Witch Queen of Helheim, slew the White Dragon
Sorcerer, and lived the life of an all-conquering hero.

After he single-handedly ended the Giant Wars by trapping the fire giant king in
his own volcano, Bödvar sensed his work was done. But he felt doomed to never be
taken by the Valkyries to Valhalla because he could never manage to be defeated
in battle. So he travelled to Asgard himself, broke down the doors and let
himself in.

Valhalla is everything Bödvar hoped - an endless reward of feasting and
fighting, with himself among its greatest champions.
